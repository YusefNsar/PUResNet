# PUResNet(Predicting protein-ligand binding sites using deep convolutional neural network)
Prediction of protein-ligand binding site is fundamental step in understanding functional characteristics of the protein which plays vital role in carrying out different biological functions and is a crucial stage in drug discovery. A protein shows its true nature after interacting with any capable molecule knows as ligand which binds only in favorable binding site of protein structure.
# Requirements
1. Tensorflow 1.11 (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
2. Keras (https://keras.io/)
3. Scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)
4. Scikit-Image (https://scikit-image.org/)
5. Open Babel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page)
6. Pybel (http://openbabel.org/docs/current/UseTheLibrary/Python_Pybel.html)
7. TFBIO (https://gitlab.com/cheminfIBB/tfbio)
8. Numpy (https://numpy.org/)
9. Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/) <br/>
Note that: It is better to setup new environment using conda or pyenv. You may need to compile open babel and tfbio if dosent installs with PIP.
